# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-App
This is a web-based application that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) drawn by the user.

The app uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, achieving an impressive <b>98% accuracy</b> on the training dataset.<br>
The user can interact with a drawing canvas to draw digits, and the app predicts the digit using a pre-trained model.<br>
The app interface is built with Streamlit, making it easy to use and deploy.
